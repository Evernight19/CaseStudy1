#### Key players in the creation of the internet:

#### Paul Baran (1926 - 2011):
#### Paul originally proposed a communication network with no central command point. He called his proposal a distributed network.

#### Lawrence Roberts (1937 - 2018):
#### Chief scientist at ARPA who was responsible for creating the first computer networks. Liked Paul Baran's idea of the distributed network and was the one who began development of the idea.

#### Leonard Kleinrock (1934 - Present):
#### Worked with Lawrence Roberts in the creation of the distributed network.

#### Donald Davies (1924 - 2000):
#### Developed similar technology to Lawrence Roberts and Leonard Kleinrock at the National Physical Laboratory in Middlesex.

#### Bob Kahn (1938 - Present) and Vint Cerf (1943 - Present):
#### American Scientists who developed TCP and IP, protocols which manage how data moves through a network.

#### Paul Mockapetris (1948 - Present) and Jon Postel (1943 - 1998):
#### Inventors of DNS, the so called 'phone book of the internet'.

#### Tim Berners-Lee (1955 - Present):
#### Creator of the World Wide Web ('WWW'), who developed many principles, such as HTML, HTTP, etc...

#### Marc Andreessen (1971 - Present):
#### Creator of the first web browser, 'Mosaic'.

While the Internet today is a place of free flowing information used by everyone, everyday world-wide, that was not always the case.
The Internet Originally began as a secure, closed information-sharing network for government utility, Mainly used by the U.S Department of Defense, as well as faculty in research institutes.
The United States Government had been extremely worried about a potential imminent attack on their communication lines from the Soviet Union during the Cold War. In response to these concerns, The Department of Self Defens, in co-operation with the Massachusettes Institute of Technology, began developing a closed computer network which would later be called Arpanet.
Thomas Merill and Lawrence Roberts, the men who created the first computer network using telephone lines, were crucial researchers in the development of Arpanent, which delivered its first message from a computer in the University of California to a computer at the Stanford Research Institute. However, despite this incredible feat, the system that was developed crashed after only two letters of the message, "login", had been transmitted, with only the 'l' and 'o' being received. By the end of this year, 4 computers would be successfully connected to Arpanet.



The original intention of Arpanet was to act as a secure method of communication, however, as it expanded and more and more people began using it, it became far more difficult to maintain it's security.
