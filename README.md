Key players in the creation of the internet:
<br>
<br>
 Paul Baran (1926 - 2011):
 
 Paul originally proposed a communication network with no central command point. He called his proposal a distributed network.
<br>
<br>
 Lawrence Roberts (1937 - 2018):
 
 Chief scientist at ARPA who was responsible for creating the first computer networks. Liked Paul Baran's idea of the distributed network and was the one who began development of the idea.
<br>
<br>
 Leonard Kleinrock (1934 - Present):
 
 Worked with Lawrence Roberts in the creation of the distributed network.
<br>
<br>
 Donald Davies (1924 - 2000):
 
 Developed similar technology to Lawrence Roberts and Leonard Kleinrock at the National Physical Laboratory in Middlesex.
<br>
<br>
 Bob Kahn (1938 - Present) and Vint Cerf (1943 - Present):
 
 American Scientists who developed TCP and IP, protocols which manage how data moves through a network.
<br>
<br>
 Paul Mockapetris (1948 - Present) and Jon Postel (1943 - 1998):
 
 Inventors of DNS, the so called 'phone book of the internet'.
<br>
<br>
 Tim Berners-Lee (1955 - Present):
 
 Creator of the World Wide Web ('WWW'), who developed many principles, such as HTML, HTTP, etc...
<br>
<br>
 Marc Andreessen (1971 - Present):
 
 Creator of the first web browser, 'Mosaic'.

While the Internet today is a place of free flowing information used by everyone, everyday world-wide, that was not always the case.
The Internet Originally began as a secure, closed information-sharing network for government utility, Mainly used by the U.S Department of Defense, as well as faculty in research institutes.

The United States Government had been extremely worried about a potential imminent attack on their communication lines from the Soviet Union during the Cold War. In response to these concerns, The Department of Self Defens, in co-operation with the Massachusettes Institute of Technology, began developing a closed computer network which would later be called Arpanet.

Thomas Merill and Lawrence Roberts, the men who created the first computer network using telephone lines, were crucial researchers in the development of Arpanent, which delivered its first message from a computer in the University of California to a computer at the Stanford Research Institute. However, despite this incredible feat, the system that was developed crashed after only two letters of the message, "login", had been transmitted, with only the 'l' and 'o' being received. By the end of this year, 4 computers would be successfully connected to Arpanet.

The first Arpanet connection made outside of the United States of America was when University College London and Norway’s Royal Radar Establishment joined. At this point, it was starting to become a challenge to integrate all the separate computers into one, single worldwide Internet. However, at this point, Arpanets existence was still unknown to the general public as it was mainly used as a secretive Defense Department tool. By the time Arpanets system had reached roughly fifty-seven network computers (and was still growing), The Defense Department in the United States had completely taken control over the running of Arpanet.
Due to the ever-increasing rate at which Arpanet was growing, it started becoming difficult to determine who was using it and what they were using it for, which in turn increased the United States Governments initial security concerns. 

In the early 1980's, researchers and the private sector in the United States took over the running and expansion of Arpanet, while the Defense Department removed their computers from it, with the reason being cited as: “sensitive nature of military systems and the increasing sophistication of civilian computer experts and illegal system trespassers, often called ‘hackers.’”. 

The first Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) was created in 1986 from a group of network designers, operators, vendors and researchers.

A mere year after the first commercial dial-up service provider was released, Arpanet was decommissioned. The United States Military then officially handed over administration to the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET). 

Tim Berners-Lee, an English computer programmer, introduced the World Wide Web, allowing the internet to be a web of information instead of simply being a network to send and receive files. In order to achieve this, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Uniform Resource Identifier and Universal Resource Locator (URI and URL), and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) were developed. This technology was made public in 1993.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
After Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web to the public, the United States Government privatised its management to keep up with the immense amount of demand. Still, a lack of regulation gave rise to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) monopoly in the United States. 
The High Performance Computing Act (HPCA) was introduced by the former Senator Al Gore and was passed by congress in 1991. This bill provided 600 million dollars for high-performance computing. It also led to the creation of many revolutionary technologies, such as high-speed fiber optic computer networks.

With help from the HPCA, researchers in the University of Illinois developed the first web browser in 1992, called Mosaic (which would later be re-named to Netscape). Mosaic allowed people to view words and pictures on the same page, with scroll bars and also clickable links. Before this, such things would appear in a new window. Also in this year, the number of computers connected to the Internet would increase pass one million.

Eventually, in 1995, the full potential of the Internet as much more than a means of simply sharing research had started to be realised. When this happened, NSFNET was dissolved, and the Internet was fully privatised. In the United States, Bill Clinton and his administration also turned over management of the Internet's backbone to the private sector. Around this time, commercialization of the Internet also began, with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) enabling online financial transactions.

With the number of Internet Addresses on different domains, such as .com - .net and .org, still rapidly increasing due to the dot-com boom, the United States Government privatised the Domain Name System (DNS). An organisation called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was inevitably formed and given the responsibility of administering policy for the Internet name and address system. 

The formation of ICANN was a major turning point in the Internets transition from its military and higher education origins.

The adoption of broadband Internet access in the early 2000's, like DSL and cable, made it possible for all people with a capable device to access the internet at significantly faster speeds, opening up new possible uses for the Internet, such as gaming and video streaming. From this point on, the Internet would begin to shift more and more away from the static, one-way communication system it had originally been designed as to an active, collaborative and participatory platform. This transformation would come to be known as "Web 2.0", a term coined by Tim O'Reilly in 2004.
<br>
<br>
This new age would be defined by a few key features:

- It is more interactive and dynamic.

- It is based on user-generated content.

- It is more personalised.

- It is more focused on community and collaboration.

- It is more business-oriented.
<br>
<br>
<br>
From the mid-2000's on, the Internet would evolve into the "Semantic Web", a vision for the Internets future in which information on the web is more connected, intelligent and easy to understand by machines, such as AI. The increase in mobile devices and wireless Internet access has made it possible to access the Internet anytime, anyplace and by anyone, at least anyone with a capable device.
This evolution is reffered to as "Web 3.0".

<br>
<br>
Web 3.0 is characterised by how:

- It is based on using new technologies.

- It is more intelligent.

- It is more decentralised.

- It is more secure.

- It is more interactive and immersive.
