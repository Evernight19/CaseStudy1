<br>
The Internet began as a military defense system in the United States of America, in the late 1960's. It was called ARPANET. The first message was sent on October 29th, 1969 from the University of California, Los Angeles to Stanford. Researchers in the United States of America, United Kingdom and France collaborated on this early network and focused on interconnecting computer networks. All of these collaborations resulted in the standardisation of TCP/IP on January 1st, 1983. This is often referred to as the "Birth of the Internet" because it meant different networks could communicate with one and other.  
<br>
<br>
Although ARPANET was a significant instrument in how the world communicates and interacts, it was very limited. Through this study, I will demonstrate how the Internet came from humble beginnings and evolved into a tool almost every person, business, Government and country relies on daily in order to live their lives.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Key players in the creation of the internet:
<br>
<br>
 Paul Baran (1926 - 2011):
 
 Paul originally proposed a communication network with no central command point. He called his proposal a distributed network.
<br>
<br>
 Lawrence Roberts (1937 - 2018):
 
 Chief scientist at ARPA who was responsible for creating the first computer networks. Liked Paul Baran's idea of the distributed network and was the one who began development of the idea.
<br>
<br>
 Leonard Kleinrock (1934 - Present):
 
 Worked with Lawrence Roberts in the creation of the distributed network.
<br>
<br>
 Donald Davies (1924 - 2000):
 
 Developed similar technology to Lawrence Roberts and Leonard Kleinrock at the National Physical Laboratory in Middlesex.
<br>
<br>
 Bob Kahn (1938 - Present) and Vint Cerf (1943 - Present):
 
 American Scientists who developed TCP and IP, protocols which manage how data moves through a network.
<br>
<br>
 Paul Mockapetris (1948 - Present) and Jon Postel (1943 - 1998):
 
 Inventors of DNS, the so called 'phone book of the internet'.
<br>
<br>
 Tim Berners-Lee (1955 - Present):
 
 Creator of the World Wide Web ('WWW'), who developed many principles, such as HTML, HTTP, etc...
<br>
<br>
 Marc Andreessen (1971 - Present):
 
 Creator of the first web browser, 'Mosaic'.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
While the Internet today is a place of free flowing information used by everyone, everyday world-wide, that was not always the case.
The Internet Originally began as a secure, closed information-sharing network for government utility, Mainly used by the United States Department of Defense, as well as faculty in research institutes.

The United States Government had been extremely worried about a potential imminent attack on their communication lines from the Soviet Union during the Cold War. In response to these concerns, The Department of Self Defense, in co-operation with the Massachusettes Institute of Technology, began developing a closed computer network which would later be called ARPANET.

Thomas Merill and Lawrence Roberts, the men who created the first computer network using telephone lines, were crucial researchers in the development of ARPANET, which delivered its first message from a computer in the University of California to a computer at the Stanford Research Institute. However, despite this incredible feat, the system that was developed crashed after only two letters of the message, "login", had been transmitted, with only the 'l' and 'o' being received. By the end of this year, 4 computers would be successfully connected to Arpanet.

The first ARPANET connection made outside of the United States of America was when University College London and Norway’s Royal Radar Establishment joined. At this point, it was starting to become a challenge to integrate all the separate computers into one, single worldwide Internet. However, at this point, Arpanets existence was still unknown to the general public as it was mainly used as a secretive Defense Department tool. By the time ARPANET's system had reached roughly fifty-seven network computers (and was still growing), The Defense Department in the United States had completely taken control over the running of Arpanet.
Due to the ever-increasing rate at which Arpanet was growing, it started becoming difficult to determine who was using it and what they were using it for, which in turn increased the United States Governments initial security concerns. 

In the early 1980's, researchers and the private sector in the United States took over the running and expansion of ARPANET, while the Defense Department removed their computers from it, with the reason being cited as: “sensitive nature of military systems and the increasing sophistication of civilian computer experts and illegal system trespassers, often called ‘hackers.’”. 

The first Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) was created in 1986 from a group of network designers, operators, vendors and researchers.

A mere year after the first commercial dial-up service provider was released, ARPANET was decommissioned. The United States Military then officially handed over administration to the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET). 

Tim Berners-Lee, an English computer programmer, introduced the World Wide Web, allowing the internet to be a web of information instead of simply being a network to send and receive files. In order to achieve this, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Uniform Resource Identifier and Universal Resource Locator (URI and URL), and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) were developed. This technology was made public in 1993.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
After Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web to the public, the United States Government privatised its management to keep up with the immense amount of demand. Still, a lack of regulation gave rise to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) monopoly in the United States. 
The High Performance Computing Act (HPCA) was introduced by the former Senator Al Gore and was passed by congress in 1991. This bill provided 600 million dollars for high-performance computing. It also led to the creation of many revolutionary technologies, such as high-speed fiber optic computer networks.

With help from the HPCA, researchers in the University of Illinois developed the first web browser in 1992, called Mosaic (which would later be re-named to Netscape). Mosaic allowed people to view words and pictures on the same page, with scroll bars and also clickable links. Before this, such things would appear in a new window. Also in this year, the number of computers connected to the Internet would increase pass one million.

Eventually, in 1995, the full potential of the Internet as much more than a means of simply sharing research had started to be realised. When this happened, NSFNET was dissolved, and the Internet was fully privatised. In the United States, Bill Clinton and his administration also turned over management of the Internet's backbone to the private sector. Around this time, commercialization of the Internet also began, with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) enabling online financial transactions.

With the number of Internet Addresses on different domains, such as .com - .net and .org, still rapidly increasing due to the dot-com boom, the United States Government privatised the Domain Name System (DNS). An organisation called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was inevitably formed and given the responsibility of administering policy for the Internet name and address system. 

The formation of ICANN was a major turning point in the Internets transition from its military and higher education origins.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The adoption of broadband Internet access in the early 2000's, like DSL and cable, made it possible for all people with a capable device to access the internet at significantly faster speeds, opening up new possible uses for the Internet, such as gaming and video streaming. From this point on, the Internet would begin to shift more and more away from the static, one-way communication system it had originally been designed as to an active, collaborative and participatory platform. This transformation would come to be known as "Web 2.0", a term coined by Tim O'Reilly in 2004.
<br>
<br>
This new age would be defined by a few key features:

- It is more interactive and dynamic.

- It is based on user-generated content.

- It is more personalised.

- It is more focused on community and collaboration.

- It is more business-oriented.
<br>
<br>
<br>
From the mid-2000's on, the Internet would evolve into the "Semantic Web", a vision for the Internets future in which information on the web is more connected, intelligent and easy to understand by machines, such as AI. The increase in mobile devices and wireless Internet access has made it possible to access the Internet anytime, anyplace and by anyone, at least anyone with a capable device.
This evolution is reffered to as "Web 3.0".

<br>
<br>
Web 3.0 is characterised by how:

- It is based on using new technologies.

- It is more intelligent.

- It is more decentralised.

- It is more secure.

- It is more interactive and immersive.
<br>

***Scientific Viewpoint Analysis:***
<br>
The development of the Internet reshaped how knowledge is created, shared and applied. It transformed research from an isolated affair into a globally interconnected enterprise, which in turn accelerated discovery across the globe.
<br>
<br>
One of the greatest benefits of the Internet is how it democratized knowledge, granting everyone limitless access to information. Online databases, digital libraries and open-acccess platforms allow scientists and others to access cutting-edge research quickly and easily. It also allows new scientific discoveries to be shared worldwide instantly.
<br>
<br>
The Internet also allows researchers to co-ordinate across borders and continents in real time, sharing data, methods and results. This ability has been crucial in projects such as climate modelling, which requires massive amounts of data and diverse expertise. Online forums and video conferencing created a culture of teamwork, breaking down barriers that once slowed progress.
<br>
<br>
The Internet enables researchers to process massive datasets in genomics, astrophysics, etc... Cloud computing and distributed networks allow computational power that was previously thought of as impossible. In addition, the rise of "Citizen Science" - non-experts contributing data through online platforms - has increased the scope of research. In addition, the Internet also allows for accelerated peer review and feedback, which allows for scientists and others to refine their work more quickly.
<br>
<br>
While the Internet has democratized science, it also offers many challenges, such as: information overload, data privacy concerns and misinformation, to name but a few. Net neutrality promotes the equal treatment of all Internet users. One of the biggest debates is "should Internet Service Providers have the power to prioritize certain content over others, thereby limiting access to information". Even so, current innovations promise to continue enhancing scientific progress.
<br>
<br>

***Societal Viewpoint Analysis:***
<br>
The development of the Internet has significantly improved and continues to improve communication, culture, commerce and social structures wolrwide. It remains both an empowering and disruptive instrument, creating both new opportunities and complex challenges.
<br>
<br>
Firstly is how the Internet radically changed communication. Emails, instant messaging and social media have replaced traditional methods of communication, like letter-writing, allowing for real-time interaction across entire countries and continents. This has created greater connectivity among individuals and communities, which in turn has torn down geographical barriers, allowing relationships to grow across borders.
<br>
<br>
Along with this, thanks to the democratization of information and knowledge, power has been shifted away from traditional gatekeepers such as libraries, colleges and the media. Anyone with a network connection can gain access to limitless amounts of information, participate in discussions and debates, and contribute to the gathering of more knowledge. This has empowered many previously unheard voices, but has also increased concerns about the spread of misinformation and the erosion of trust in higher authorititative sources.
<br>
<br>
Everyday social life has also been influenced immensely by the rise of e-commerce and digital economies. Online shopping and digital banking have changed how most people work, shop and manage finances. This has created more opportunities for entrepreneurs and global trade, but in turn has also caused damage to traditional industries, leading to job displacement. On top of this, the Internet has become the perfect space for cultural exchange. Social media platforms have allowed people to express themselves, build communities and engage in cultural exchanges. Despite this, the Internet has also introduced problems like cyber-bullying and targeted harassment.
<br>
<br>
<br>

***Ethical Reflection & Improvements:***
<br>
Ethical matters comprise of privacy concerns, misinformation, net neutrality, data security and the digital divide. All of these issues have implications for both individuals and society in general. 
<br>
<br>
When it comes to privacy and data protection, many users are not aware of the extent to which their data is being used and stored by Governments and organisations. The majority of people do not read the fine print and end up signing contracts without being fully informed of the more complex implications. While many companies have made an effort to be more transparent by the use of increased literature/leaflets and advertising, most individuals simply ignore these enhancements. 
<br>
<br>
There has been an immense increase of misinformation and cyber-attacks, especially in recent years. The rise of social media platforms, such as Instagram and X (Twitter), pose ethical challenges, dissemination of false information, and the impact it has on the worlds population. The growth of deepfake technology and AI has complicated this. The amount of cyber-attack breaches leaves individuals and companies in a vulnerable position because hackers are accessing their private data. Improvements in cyber-security must be updated continually by both individuals and organisations. 
<br>
<br>
It is the responsibility of IT professionals to undertake ethical responsibilities of the work that they develop. It is up to them to ensure that the products that they create do not enable surveillance, or facilitate cyber-bullying. This is an ongoing and ever-evolving concern.
<br>
<br>
Depending on your demographic or region in the world, depends on your access to the Internet. It is not the same for everyone. This is what is called the "Digital Divide". Many people do not have the resources to access the Internet and benefit from its abundance of information. Therefore, the question can be asked, "Should access to the Internet be considered a basic human right?".
<br>
<br>
***Conclusion:***
<br>
The story of the Internets development is one of an incredible transformation over many decades. From its beginnings as an experiment of secure communication during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, to the most powerful and extensive technological infrastructure in the history of human kind. From the days of ARPANET, with researchers struggling to transmit more than two letters of a message, "l" - "o" from what was meant to be "login", to the modern day of Web 3.0, characterised by intelligence, decentralisation and immersive interactivity. The Internet's upward trajectory reflects both the ingenuity of its inventors and the adaptibility of society to these new modes of communication. 
<br>
<br>
Thanks to the contributions of pioneers like Paul Baran, Lawrence Roberts, Leonard Kleinrock, Donald Davies, Bob Kahn, Vint Cerf, Paul Mockapetris, Jon Postel, Tim Berners-Lee and Marc Andreessen, we have a clear illustration of how innovation is rarely, if ever, the work of just one single mind. Instead, it is often down to the combined efforts of many individuals collaborating across borders and decades. Each of these individuals contributed a crucial piece to complete the puzzle: distributed networking, packet switching, TCP/IP protocols, DNS, the World Wide Web and the first web browser. Together, their work laid the foundation for an incredible system that today connects billions of computers and various devices worldwide.
<br>
<br>
The early militaristic and academic roots of the Internet highlight its original purpose: resiliance and security against geopolitical threats. However, once the private sector and general public gained access to this incredible technology, its potential was expanded far beyond its original intent and beyond what was ever thought to be possible. 

The rise of Internet Service Providers and commercialisation of domains during the dot-com boom marked a turning point. The Internet stopped being a specialised tool and started to become a global marketplace, a cultural epicenter, and a social lifeline. Thanks to the birth of broadband in the early 2000's, this transformation was rapidly accelerated, enabling many new media experiences such as video streaming and gaming, while paving the way for what would be known as Web 2.0, a collaborative environment build by user-generated content, personalisation and community.
<br> 
<br>
From the foundations of Web 2.0, the Internet would enter Web 3.0, an era where intelligence, decentralisation and security became the defining features. The Semantic Web sought to make information machine-readable, enabling AI to interpret and connect data in ways that humans alone could not. The development of mobile devices and wireless enables individuals to connect to this amazing system anytime and anywhere, so long as they had access to one of these machines. This would also come to affect the progression of scientific discoveries.
<br>
<br>
From a scientific perspective, the Internet democratised knowledge and increased the rate of discovery. Researchers are now capable of colaborating across continents in real-time, allowing them to share data and methods that traditionaly would have taken months, possibly years, to circulate. Projects such as climate modelling or genomic sequencing are made possible thanks to distributed networks and cloud computing. The everyday person now also has the ability to contribute to these incredible discoveries.
Despite this, however, there are still many challenges, including, but not limited to, information overload, data privacy concerns, the spread of misinformation and cyber-attacks. 
<br>
<br>
Societally, the Internet has managed to reshape how we communicate, commerce and our culture. It has torn down geographical barriers and allowed relationships to flourish across borders. By acting as a global, digital library, the Internet has shifted power away from traditional gatekeepers, empowering people to access and share information freely. E-commerce and digital banking have transformed economies, creating new opportunities while also disrupting established industries. Despite its benefits, however, it has also brought many new risks and challenges, such as: cyber-bullying, harassment and the growing distrust in authoritative sources.
<br>
<br>
The Internet has, and continues to, raise many profound ethical questions in relation to privacy, misinformation and cyber-security. Many users remain blissfully unaware of just how their data is being collected, stored and exploited, with them often agreeing to contract terms that they have not fully read or do not fully understand.
With the rise in deepfake technology and AI-driven manipulation, the situation has become much more complicated than it was before, blurring the line between the truth and lies.
Cyber-attacks threaten both people and businesses, requiring IT professionals to bear the responsibility to ensure that the systems they design do not enable surveillance, exploitation or harm.
The "Digital Divide" also reminds us that access to the Internet is not universal. For many people around the globe, connectivity is not a right and is instead considered a privilege, which raises the question whether Internet access should be considered a basic human right in the modern age.
<br>
<br>
Together, these dimensions reveal that the Internet is a double-edged sword. It is simultaneously a tool of empowerment, collaboration and progress, while also being a source of disruption, inequality and risk. The history of its development demonstrates that technological innovation is one and the same with humanities values and choices. The innovators who created the Internet pictured resilience, openness and utility. Now, the people who use it today must decide how to continue with these ideals while also addressing these new challenges.
